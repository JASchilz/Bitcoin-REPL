Visit [Bower.io](http://bower.io) for information on installing and using Bower.\r\n\r\nOnce you have Bower installed, clone this repository to your host, `cd` into the directory, run `bower install` , and point your web browser at `index.html`.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse\r\n===\r\n\r\nOnce in the Bitcoin-REPL terminal, try typing `:help` or `:operations` for more instructions.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples:\r\n\r\nEnter a list of operations and press enter to evaluate:\r\n```\r\n>>> OP_1 OP_2 OP_ADD       'enter'\r\n(0x03)\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPressing shift-enter will evaluate a single instruction:\r\n```\r\n>>> OP_1 OP_2 OP_ADD       'shift-enter'\r\n>>> (0x01) OP_2 OP_ADD     'shift-enter'\r\n>>> (0x01 0x02) OP_ADD     'shift-enter'\r\n```\r\n\r\nStack contents are represented in parenthesis with the stack-head to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\n\r\nMany of the operations are not yet implemented. However, this project is under active development and most or all operations will be added shortly.\r\n\r\nSee GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/JASchilz/Bitcoin-REPL/issues/) for additional issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Involved\r\n================\r\n\r\nFeel free to open pull requests or issues.
